the famous assets/ folder:
	moves to bbl-middleman/source/mackerel-chrome/assets

the styles that I'd like both of you to work on:
	bbl-middleman/source/mackerel-chrome/assets

content to be managed by the content manager:
	webpages
		e.g. 	
			bbl-middleman/source/tagyeti/index.html.haml
	images
		e.g.
			bbl-middleman/source/images/tagyeti/marketing.png


it's important to remember, nothing will break. so don't be shy with adding stuff, changing stuff according to common sense and your logical thoughts.

if you have questions, reason with yourself to see if it's a good question, then ask me.

This is very important stuff, I'd like everyone to come along to get the knowledge transfer done as smoothly as possible.

I'd like to do this with M3.
