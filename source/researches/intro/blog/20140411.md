As the surge in commits for the [filtering plugin] settle down, I'm uploading another build of [Researches.app]. The full story's still very much untold, as Researches.io remains in its mildly enigmatic form, but I'm happy to see the machinery settle down and the context around the [engine] to form.

It also feels awesome to have pulled another project off the pipeline, with a collaborator who is reliable, articulate and motivated. The sneakers project is moving. []

To top it all off, I had a couple of deeply technical and insightful chats today, with Lukas from upfront.io and Michael from *redacted*. 

Some days, nothing beats going off on my own.
