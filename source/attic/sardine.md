# Sardine


Sardine was an experimental project that explored user interface designs for high-volume inbound information, such as a Twitter feed.

The primary focus of the project was to study the mutual effects of:
- a mental model centered around topics contained in the stream, rather than a singular chronological stream of information;
- dynamic and interactive visualisation of such topics, rather than the timeline.

Interesting design and technical challenges included:
- working with tag cloud visualisation libraries;
- understanding the nuances of text visualisation and requisite qualities of the visualised data;
- interop of native, co-located web and remote web components in a hybrid client application;
- critical factors in a project that employs multiple programming languages numerous open source projects, and rapid UI iterations.
