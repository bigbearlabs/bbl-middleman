## Redundant searches

You know, when you Google something, then refine your search terms (aka [pearl growing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_growing)), then follow a long trail in the quest for true relevance. You got to that hard-to-get and important thing you were hunting down. Yay!

The next time you search for this though -- that's when your efforts are redundant.

How often do you do this without thinking? Why is such recurrent pain necessary? Why should you keep working for stuff you've already worked to find?

Or maybe you do too much online, your organisation scheme morphs too often, or your interests change too frequently. Should have bookmarked it, right?

Just kidding, if you think bookmarking no longer works, we fully. 

Bookmarking is no longer an effective way to recall important information when you need, in an age where you switch devices to deal with an ever-increasing inflow of data, and what you would deem valuable or bookmark-worthy is increasingly harder to decide.

That's why we're building [WebBuddy 2](http://alpha.webbuddyapp.com). Bookmarks were fine things when they worked. But, in this day and age, bookmarks should be laid to rest.
