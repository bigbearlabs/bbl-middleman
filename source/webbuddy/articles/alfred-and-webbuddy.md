To many people, the address bar (also known as the omnibar) is synonymous with browsing. You might have wondered, can a browser do without it? 

We have too. We've prototyped several address bars, and really, it's not easy to make a good one. [^]


One of the things it does really well is to start searching the internet. And it works really well with [WebBuddy]. Just call Alfred, type, then hit Return -- now WebBuddy loads the page.

Once you get comfortable with this fast workflow, free from distractions in your browsers, it can become [pretty addicting].


If you'd like to quickly search for something, type it into Alfred and hit Enter. 




 ^ We found the proposition of making a really good address bar very hard to swallos, as users of the excellent Alfred. The fast, useful, beautiful search tool for OS X is such that if you like software, you should definitely use this guy.
