## Browser Babysitting

What is browser babysitting? 

It's the thing you're used to as an intense user of the web -- the careful choreographing of the tabs in your browser windows; the constant decision-making of whether you should bookmark this, close this, or leave it for later, or whether to send it for somewhere, and if so, where it should best be sent.

It's the thing you have to deal with, in order to avoid dealing with the *tab clutter monster*. It's the thing you deal with better when you're energetic, procrastinating or you've decided there's just too much clutter to ignore. It's also the thing you tend to lapse on, especially during those times when you need to get things done.
