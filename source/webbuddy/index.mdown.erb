### Streamlined access to URLs.
Preview links from OS X Mail, Twitter or Evernote quickly and without distraction -- keep your focus on the current working context. Hit the Escape key to go right back to where you were.

### Web productivity booster.
Dealing with your web browsing activity in context reduces clutter in your main browser. Enjoy far fewer tabs in your browsers, and far less browser driving().

### Full-screen savvy.
Great apps like Mail, iPhoto or iTunes really come alive in full-screen mode. Seamlessly weave in and out of the web, without getting bounced around different workspaces.
