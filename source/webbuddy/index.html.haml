  ### Web productivity booster.

  Working with links within your workflow and mental context reduces clutter in your main browser.

  Preview links from OS X Mail, Twitter or Evernote in a HUD panel - keep your focus on the current working context. 

   Enjoy far fewer tabs in your browsers. Spend less time switching between apps and browsers.

  ### Designed to reduce clutter.

  Ever had an occasion to wake up your Mac to get something done, then got lost in all the browser tabs? You'll be surprised by how much WebBuddy will reduce your open tabs. 

  There's a lot of web information accessed from apps via hyperlinks. WebBuddy is designed to specialise in handling these so your main browser can deal with less.

  </section>

  <section markdown="1">

  ### Your choice of browser.

  View all links using WebBuddy, then selectively commit to do more work with them with your browser or other tool, such as Evernote. 

  If you use many browsers, open links in a browser of choice by clicking with modifier keys configured in WebBuddy.

  ### Full-screen savvy.

  Great apps like Mail, iPhoto or iTunes really come alive in full-screen mode. 

  Seamlessly weave in and out of the web while in your full-screen workflow. You'll never get bounced to another space after clicking a link again.

     - "Ever had a moment staring at the tabs in your browser window, wondering: 'what were all of these pages about?'"
     - Every time you click a link from a Mac app such as Mail.app, Twitter.app or Evernote to view it, your workflow is disrupted as you get thrown into your browser. And these days, there are probably many pages already open in your browser, making it confusing and distracting to focus on your task.
     - WebBuddy is like Quick Look for the web - it lets you view the link in your current working context, in a minimal HUD panel.

     blurb:
     - Use WebBuddy as a preview tool, and perform quick one-off web activity away from your main browser. When you decide you need to do some serious work with webpage from a workflow that started with an e-mail, just send the current page from WebBuddy to your browser of choice. Try it for a few days, and enjoy the radical reduction of clutter in Safari or Chrome.
