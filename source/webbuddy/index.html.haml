    Make web activity more efficient and fluid with WebBuddy.  


  ### Web productivity booster.

  Dealing with your web browsing activity in context reduces clutter in your main browser. Enjoy far fewer tabs in your browsers, and far less browser driving().


  ## Features


  ### Streamlined access to URLs.

  Preview links from OS X Mail, Twitter or Evernote in a HUD panel - keep your focus on the current working context. 

  Drastically reduce time switching between app and browser by dealing with inbound information quickly and efficiently.


  ### Designed to reduce clutter.

  Ever had an occasion to wake your Mac to get something done, but got lost in all the browser tabs? You'll be surprised by how much WebBuddy will reduce your open tabs. 

  There's a lot of web information accessed from apps via hyperlinks. WebBuddy is designed to specialise in handling these so your main browser can deal with less.


  ### Your choice of browser.

  By viewing hyperlinks with WebBuddy, then selectively committing to 'work' with them with your browser or another URL handler, such as Evernote, you can enhance your workflow and deal with less web clutter.

  In addition to opening content in a context-friendly window, you can open hyperlinks in a different browser of your choosing by clicking with the modifer keys, allowing WebBuddy to become a ad-hoc browser selector.


  ### Full-screen savvy.

  Great apps like Mail, iPhoto or iTunes really come alive in full-screen mode. Seamlessly weave in and out of the web, without getting bounced around different workspaces.

  You'll never get bounced around spaces after clicking a link.

    - "Ever had a moment staring at the tabs in your browser window, wondering: 'what were all of these pages about?'"
    - Every time you click a link from a Mac app such as Mail.app, Twitter.app or Evernote to view it, your workflow is disrupted as you get thrown into your browser. And these days, there are probably many pages already open in your browser, making it confusing and distracting to focus on your task.
    - WebBuddy is like Quick Look for the web - it lets you view the link in your current working context, in a minimal HUD panel.

    blurb:
    - Use WebBuddy as a preview tool, and perform quick one-off web activity away from your main browser. When you decide you need to do some serious work with webpage from a workflow that started with an e-mail, just send the current page from WebBuddy to your browser of choice. Try it for a few days, and enjoy the radical reduction of clutter in Safari or Chrome.
