  subtitle: Preview links from OS X Mail, Twitter or Evernote in a HUD panel - keep your focus on the current working context.
  blurb:
    - "Ever had a moment staring at the tabs in your browser window, wondering: 'what were all of these pages about?'"
    - Every time you click a link from a Mac app such as Mail.app, Twitter.app or Evernote to view it, your workflow is disrupted as you get thrown into your browser. And these days, there are probably many pages already open in your browser, making it confusing and distracting to focus on your task.
    - WebBuddy is like Quick Look for the web - it lets you view the link in your current working context, in a minimal HUD panel.

  subtitle: Reduce clutter in your main browser by choosing what to send over to which browser at the right moment.
  blurb:
    - Use WebBuddy as a preview tool, and perform quick one-off web activity away from your main browser. When you decide you need to do some serious work with webpage from a workflow that started with an e-mail, just send the current page from WebBuddy to your browser of choice. Try it for a few days, and enjoy the radical reduction of clutter in Safari or Chrome.

  subtitle: Peek into the web while working in full-screen mode with your favorite full-screen app.
  blurb:
    - The full screen mode available since Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) is great for focused workflows around a productivity app. Until, that is, you need to quickly reference something on the web.
    - WebBuddy allows you to perform quick web tasks without leaving full screen mode, making it a perfect tool for looking up references or resources, or performing quick side-tracking tasks while in full screen mode.
