      ### Web productivity booster.

      Working with links within your workflow and mental context reduces clutter in your main browser.

      Preview links from OS X Mail, Twitter or Evernote quickly and without distraction -- keep your focus on the current working context. Hit the Escape key to go right back to where you were.

      ### Minimal chrome.

      WebBuddy's chrome recedes as you work with 
      web content. The result -- the content really comes out. 

      Hover over the title bar to reveal the toolbar for actions on the page.

      ### Plays nicely with other browsers.

      Use WebBuddy as a preview tool for links in apps, then selectively commit to do more work with content with your main browser or other tool, such as Evernote. 

      Open links directly in a browser of choice by clicking it with modifier keys configured in WebBuddy.

      ### Full-screen savvy.

      Great apps like Mail, iPhoto or iTunes really come alive in full-screen mode. 

      Seamlessly weave in and out of the web while in your full-screen workflow. You'll never get bounced to another space after clicking a link again.

  -#   - "Ever had a moment staring at the tabs in your browser window, wondering: 'what were all of these pages about?'"
  -#   - Every time you click a link from a Mac app such as Mail.app, Twitter.app or Evernote to view it, your workflow is disrupted as you get thrown into your browser. And these days, there are probably many pages already open in your browser, making it confusing and distracting to focus on your task.
  -#   - WebBuddy is like Quick Look for the web - it lets you view the link in your current working context, in a minimal HUD panel.

  -#   blurb:
  -#   - Use WebBuddy as a preview tool, and perform quick one-off web activity away from your main browser. When you decide you need to do some serious work with webpage from a workflow that started with an e-mail, just send the current page from WebBuddy to your browser of choice. Try it for a few days, and enjoy the radical reduction of clutter in Safari or Chrome.
