# SafariHere


## Less bounce, more browse.

SafariHere is a small app designed to fix an irritating issue when you you work with multiple spaces and Safari.

Every now and then you'll click on a link and get thrown out of your current space because there wasn't a Safari window open in that space. Over time, this can reduce your life expentancy.

### How to use

Set SafariHere as the default browser instead of Safari.

When you click on a link, SafariHere will create a new Safari window in the current space if necessary, before opening the link. No more flying around between spaces.
