# Wanna build something insanely great?

## We consult on iOS, Mac and web application development.

### Rapid mobile app prototyping 

We are experts at combining web and native technologies for fast iterations on mobile apps. 

Focus on customer development and discovering the minimum scope for a viable product, without being hampered by slow pace of software development. 


### WebKit integration / in-app browser implementation

WebKit lets your app leverage a decade of hard work by the open source community, and vast amounts of content on the web. It's also far from trivial to work with -- the learning curve beyond the basics is steep, complete with own subtle gotchas.

Focus on the features that make your app unique, by leaving the  engineering for your app's in-app browser or other WebKit-based features to us.
