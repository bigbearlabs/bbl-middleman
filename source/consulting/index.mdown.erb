# Wanna build something insanely great?

## We consult on iOS, Mac and web application development.

---

### Rapid mobile app prototyping 

We are experts at combining web and native technologies for fast iterations on apps for the iOS platform. 

Especially during prototyping stage, fast iteration is key, since there are lots of user experience problems you'd want to find out, but before your design is finalised.

Let us help you leverage your web expertise, to build rapidly build out native apps.

### RubyMotion workshops / coaching

We've been working on iOS since the beta came out in 2008. We've been working with RubyMotion since 1.0, and with MacRuby before then. We've made all the mistakes you'll make.

Over a couple of days, we can spend building a RubyMotion app together, running on iOS. Need to ship to iOS fast? If you're a web shop, we'll get you going very quickly using our native + web prototyping strategy.

### WebKit integration / in-app browser

WebKit lets your app leverage a decade of hard work by the open source community, and vast amounts of content on the web, right inside your app. 

It's also far from trivial to work with -- the learning curve beyond the basics is steep, complete with own subtle gotchas, the result of serious real-life engineering.

Focus on the features that make your app unique, by leaving the  engineering for your app's in-app browser or other WebKit-based features to us.

### In-app stores

Can you just flick a finger, and get a beautiful, popular in-app store? Well, not quite that easy, but we can help you some of the way.

We'll start with a base design and an up-to-date review of the tools to pick. Within a few days, you'll be able to prototype a store, collect payments using a payments API, and ship a UI for transactions right in your app.

### Client-server integration

We'll share our experience in working with complex stacks of technology, and work with you for API design, data transformations, modeling and reuse maximisation. 

Got servers based on Java, Ruby, Python, Go, or Node.js, and need to get a mobile app running *fast*? We'll share all the patterns.
