# Wanna build something insanely great?

## We consult on iOS, Mac and web application development.

### Rapid mobile app prototyping 
- Leveraging web and native technologies
- Focus on customer development and scope for minimum viable product, without being hampered by slow pace of software development


### WebKit integration / in-app browser implementation

WebKit lets your app leverage a decade of hard work by the open source community, and vast amounts of content on the web. It's also far from trivial to work with -- a steep learning curve beyond the basics and with its own subtle gotchas.

Focus on the features that make your app unique, by leaving the  engineering for your app's in-app browser or other WebKit-based features to us. 

[open source projects]


### RubyMotion workshops / coaching


### Lean software development strategy


### Client-server integration
